# Week 5 â€“ Spring Boot Microservices Project

## Folder Naming

This `week-5/6366817/` folder follows the project instruction that requires naming the project folder using the **employee ID**.  
**6366817** is my unique Superset ID (used as employee identifier for assessment submission).

---

### How to Run

Each microservice is a standalone Maven project. Build and run them separately:
Account Service

cd 6366817/microservices/account
mvn clean package
java -jar target/account-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Loan Service

cd 6366817/microservices/loan
mvn clean package
java -jar target/loan-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
